--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The aim of torchtime is to apply [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) to
the time series domain. By supporting PyTorch, torchtime follows the same philosophy
of providing strong GPU acceleration, having a focus on trainable features through
the autograd system, and having consistent style (tensor names and dimension names).
Therefore, it is primarily a machine learning library and not a general signal
processing library. The benefits of PyTorch can be seen in torchtime through
having all the computations be through PyTorch operations which makes it easy
to use and feel like a natural extension.
